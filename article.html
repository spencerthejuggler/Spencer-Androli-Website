    <h2>4 Key Ways to Improve Your Juggling</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Intro:</strong></p>
    <p>
      Throughout my years of juggling, I have learned and taken note of things that helped me drastically improve my technique. These are things that if I would have applied earlier, I would've practiced smarter not harder. Also, keeping in mind these things can remove you from plateaus whenever you encounter them if you can analyze what you are doing correctly. I am writing this because I notice some subtle things that jugglers do that in my opinion limit their potential and at least seeing these things in myself can increase the efficiency of my juggling. I believe that applying and keeping in mind these concepts will truly improve your juggling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Obviously, nothing will improve your juggling in a greater way than diligent practice and consistency training. However, by keeping these things in mind as practice goes on, I think that you will be more encouraged and motivated to keep practicing as you analyze and correct the technique that you are attempting a trick with. I will say, these concepts have personally made my patterns smoother, more enjoyable to do, and better to look at.
    </p>
    <p>
      A helpful tip when reading through this and processing these tips is to keep in mind a trick that you have been working on that has been giving you trouble and question whether either of these points could be applied to better that trick.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Breathe</h3>
    <p>
      In order to talk about this, I have to give massive credit to Tom Whitfield. I took his workshop at IJA 2019 in Fort Wayne, Indiana on numbers juggling. That workshop not only changed how I view numbers juggling and its difficulty but its application for juggling tricks in general. He emphasized the concept of a stable breathing pattern in order to maintain high numbers patterns more effectively. Truly, he practices what he preaches as he has the cleanest numbers juggling out there.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with everything in life, it's always good to breathe. Breathing makes you do things better. It improves your reaction time and allows you to think more clearly. We obviously need to breathe to stay alive, so think you need to breathe in order to keep the pattern alive. As simple as it seems, so many jugglers forget to do so while they juggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some hold their breath as they juggle physically strenuous patterns. Not breathing properly while making throws, limits the pattern and will cause it to most likely not last as long as it could. It is important to remember to keep your breathing consistent to maintain your juggling consistent, clean, and efficient. Staying calm, a result of breathing properly, is important despite the number you're juggling or the crazy trick you're doing. Staying calm and focused during stressful situations allows you to react better. Breathing can make the difference between nailing a trick or fumbling through it for hours and using up too much unnecessary energy. Too often we get too excited that we are about to nail a trick after having been so close, so we-try it again right after we drop. Remember, it is more effective to compose yourself before every attempt because that will create more success on the next attempt and reduce exhaustion which often leads to more failed attempts.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Control your Facial Expressions as Best as You Can</h3>
    <p>
      Along with the previous point, the facial expressions we make as we juggle can impact our juggling. Many people call it “the jugglers face”. (On a personal note, this is one of my biggest struggles while juggling and I definitely am constantly being mindful of reducing this tendency.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Oftentimes, when a trick is not going well or feels harder than it should be, it is due to disobeying this rule. The reason we should have control over our facial expressions is because oftentimes we rely on them and through doing so create more tension in the shoulders and body. If we are juggling especially at a high speed, we have to be loose and agile, not stiff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, creating a neutral face avoids relying on any muscle to create tension. Sometimes a smile can be a way to preserve and amplify tension. I’m not at all against smiling while juggling, especially in performance. I just know that you have to have enough control not to rely on it too much that it creates the tension that makes juggling harder than it needs to be.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Know the Rhythm of the Pattern</h3>
    <p>
      Apart from breathing and keeping your body relaxed, let’s talk about the juggling patterns themselves. I have found that in juggling, rhythm is everything. Many people even call juggling a form of visual music. I would agree that every motion of siteswap and pattern has a rhythm that makes it feasible and in which the positioning of the props and the speed of gravity lines up to fall at correct moments. When juggling patterns are done out of the correct rhythm, that is when they become unnecessarily hard and frustrating.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding the rhythm of a pattern isn't as hard as it seems especially in the internet age of Instagram and YouTube. I've found that when learning a juggling trick or a new siteswap, visuals are often extremely helpful. Seeing a video of the pattern or the siteswap on Juggling Lab (or most siteswap generators), the rhythm of the pattern becomes evident and I am able to imitate it. Often when juggling tricks aren't clicking or are feeling strange in executing them, examining the rhythm of the throws by watching a video of the trick well executed will be your best advice in nailing a trick.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from using visuals, however, when working on a trick, questioning the height of each throw is also a good way to go at it. Asking yourself, what if I make this throw higher? What if I make this throw shorter? What if I make this throw faster or slower? These are all ways you can use to refine how you do a trick that can increase efficiency and really make a trick a lot easier and more feasible with this kind of fine tuning.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Don't Reach Up but Let Them Fall</h3>
    <p>
      This tip relates to the previous pointers, primarily when it comes to timing and tension. A common way that people mess up the timing and often create tension in their juggling is through reaching upward to catch or raising their arms too high as they juggle. I'd recommend allowing the objects to fall into your hands. If they aren't making it to your hands, work on making better throws that cause you to keep your hands in a consistent spot. I'd recommend not raising your arms above your elbow. Juggle by bending your elbow and catching the objects as low as you feel comfortable as it allows more time to react, catch, and make the next throw. Reaching up causes you to ruin the flow of the juggling and not give enough time to bring your arm down to the normal position in which you are most comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping your arms low allows you to relax and flow with the pattern which as a result makes you breathe better and reduce stiffness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keeping my arms low has become key to keeping my juggling patterns clean and at a consistent rhythm to get longer runs and greater tricks.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      To conclude, juggling is hard, but with proper technique and just self-examination and analysis it can be not as hard. Just to clarify, these pointers are often the goal and they can for sure take some time adjusting after using inefficient technique, but they are worth it in the long run. Keep being patient with the process and learn to love it. And as always feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
