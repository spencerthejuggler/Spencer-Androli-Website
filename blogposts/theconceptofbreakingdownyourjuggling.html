    <h2>The Concept of Breaking Down Your Juggling</h2>
    <article>
      <!-- Your provided article content goes here -->
      <p>Thinking about advanced jugglers and key essential tools that we must have, I believe learning how to break down a trick is essential. Just to clarify, when I say advanced jugglers, I mean jugglers that feel that tutorials don’t offer them any more assistance to keep advancing. Those who want to push further than what there are resources for. This article applies to you if you have some tricks that you have in mind but struggle to execute. The reality is sometimes we have to teach ourselves at times and guide ourselves through analyzing what needs to be done. A lot of juggling is a lot of repetition and a collection of drills that serves us by teaching us muscle memory in order to make the patterns click and be executed with ease and in rapid succession.</p>
      
      <h3>Numbers training:</h3>
      <p>To train numbers, we have to set a good foundation of solid throws. Proper height and rhythm is required. If you are working on 7 balls for example, you have to comfortably throw at the height of a 7 accurately as well as do it fast enough to keep up with the rhythm that is a 7 ball pattern. In this case, how I would break it down is work on patterns that include this speed and accuracy with a lower amount of objects. Luckily siteswaps offer that option. In this scenario, finding siteswaps with a 7 in them would be essential to practice. So when you are training towards a 7 ball cascade, I would recommend warming up with perhaps 72222, 70701, 7070700 (3 ball), 741, 73334, 7531 (4 ball), 744, 771, 753, 77722, 777711, 7777700 (5 ball), 75, 756, 774, 77736, 7777716, 7777770 (6 ball), etc. Obviously some of these may not be super convenient for you in the scenario that you are only trying to do a flash or qualify at the moment. Feel free to do some of the more simpler and more doable ones at the moment in order to trigger the 7 height and rhythm muscle memory.</p>
      
      <p>Another way of breaking down numbers juggling if you are working on the running of a pattern is to start small and consistent and start getting bigger. If you want to get better at running 7 balls, try flashing it several times and set a goal to do it as perfectly as you can 3 times in a row if that is attainable. Then from there start adding up throws incrementally and in each new set of throws try doing it 3 times in a row as well. Once you’ve done this enough times adding more and more catches and establishing a good foundation, go for the longest run you can.</p>
      
      <p>I can guarantee that this way of training is effective due to its repetitive nature aiding with repetitive patterns. This is like doing reps with heavy weights at the gym, the more you do it consistently the easier and more consistent it becomes however it is all a journey with good days and bad days.</p>
      
      <h3>Analyzing and Improving a Trick:</h3>
      <p>Another way breaking down a trick could be useful is to analyze how a trick may be going wrong and not fitting within its intended rhythm. Oftentimes, we may be struggling to run a pattern such as a siteswap like 744. You may feel rushed when attempting it or perhaps it is too slow or drawn out. In this scenario, asking the question, “should I throw higher or lower?” is important. When you ask that question, you can get more specific and ask, “which throws should I try throwing higher or lower?” In a 744, if you are feeling rushed perhaps the 7 has to be higher and 4s lower. Or maybe the 7 is high enough and the 4s are too high pushing the timing to be rushed. This is where attempting these different versions is important to determine which one is the solution. Rhythm is important in each juggling pattern that is done and there must be a steady tempo when each pattern is run.</p>
      
      <p>Another random tip when analyzing and improving running a siteswap is to either find a video of someone running the siteswap you are working on or plug it into JugglingLab and play at a tempo that seems like a realistic speed in which to juggle it in to get a proper visual to imitate. Sometimes seeing the trick visually helps with understanding the proper tempo.</p>
      
      <p>Not just with sitewaps does analyzing a trick in this way serve a purpose but also in body throws, trying adjusting your form of throwing is by measuring if more force is necessary or if the technique is efficient.</p>
      
      <h3>Breaking down a Trick to Find More Tricks:</h3>
      <p>The fascinating thing about juggling is that there are infinite variations to a trick. Creativity is a skill to be learned but one method that I believe works well is understanding a trick thoroughly enough to play with endless variations. For example, understanding the siteswap you are doing and seeing what throws and catches should be done differently.</p>
      
      <p>I think that each object thrown in a trick can be broken down into 3 parts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How do you throw it? Example: Backross, Overhead, Under the leg, Reverse, etc.</li>
        <li>What does the throw go through while in the air (if applicable)? Example: Behind the head, beside the arm, under leg, just normally in the air, etc. (I guess there are 5 holes in between the limbs that an object can go through.)</li>
        <li>How do you catch the object? Penguin, chop, balance, etc.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>With knowing these 3 things applied to a pattern or a random siteswap, you can start creating variations and new tricks.</p>
      
      <p>Take a 423, for example. You can create a lot of variations using the concept of catching and throwing from underneath the leg for example. The 4 can be caught underneath the leg while the 2 and 3 are normal. It can also be thrown underneath the leg and caught normally. It can also be both thrown and caught underneath the leg. You can do the same for each individual element of a 423. Even the basic pattern of 423 can be made very complicated with a mix of body throws.</p>
      
      <p>Another random concept that is worth mentioning which I’ve played with briefly is to play around with the nature of even and odd throws. For example, in the pattern 774 with 6 objects. In this case, the 4 could be thrown across the body and caught by the same hand on the opposite side in the form of an under the arm or under the leg for example. Theoretically the 7s in this pattern could be thrown to the same side and not cross the body but caught by opposing hands. That would definitely be very difficult, but would truly be a cool idea. But, to put this concept in simpler terms a 441 could be used as well by making the 4s crossed and caught if run continuously by crossing and uncrossing hands with honestly even more variations there.</p>
      
      <p>To conclude this section, to find more tricks you can analyze each pattern you do by experimenting with where the balls go and how they are thrown, which area of the body they go through, and in which way you catch the object.</p>
      
      <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
      <p>Try using one of these methods on a trick you are working on. I would also recommend checking out my previous article "4 Key Principles to Improve Your Juggling" as it is somewhat similar to this and may it also offers even more thoughts on improving juggling.</p>
